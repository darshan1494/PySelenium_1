'''
Selenium handles only automation part:
Selenium is not a testing framework and it can automate only browsers.

Test case Steps:
Open the Browser
Navigate to URL
Find the Email Web-element & enter  email id= "abc@gmail.com"
Find the Password input box & enter the password=123
Click on Sign-in Button
'''


'''
Verification part/Assertion part is taken care by Pytest testing framework.
1.Verify that the dashboard is completely loaded.
2.Create a report to share with QA team , QA lead, QA Manager with the help of HTML/Allure reporting mechanism.

How to find the elements in Selenium?
🔎 Locators in Selenium
A locator is a way of identifying an element on a web page so that it can be interacted with.
There are several different types of locators that can be used, including:
● ID: This locator type uses the unique ID attribute of an element to locate it on the
page.
● Name: This locator type uses the name attribute of an element to locate it on the
page.
● Class name: This locator type uses the class attribute of an element to locate it on
the page.
● Tag name: This locator type uses the HTML tag name of an element to locate it on
the page.
● Link text: This locator type uses the text of a link to locate it on the page.
● Partial link text: This locator type uses part of the text of a link to locate it on the
page.
● CSS selector: This locator type uses a CSS selector to locate an element on the
page.
● Xpath: This locator type uses an XPath expression to locate an element on the page.
● When writing test scripts with Selenium, you can use a combination of these locator
types to accurately and reliably locate elements on the page.


● find_element_by_id: Finds an element by its unique id attribute.
● find_element_by_name: Finds an element by its name attribute.
● find_element_by_xpath: Finds an element using an XPath expression.
● find_element_by_link_text: Finds an anchor element (a) by its visible text.
● find_element_by_partial_link_text: Finds an anchor element (a) by a partial match of
its visible text.
● find_element_by_tag_name: Finds an element by its HTML tag name (e.g., "div",
"input", "a", etc.).
● find_element_by_class_name: Finds an element by its CSS class name.
● find_element_by_css_selector: Finds an element using a CSS selector.

For multiple elements, you can use the plural versions of these functions.
● (e.g., find_elements_by_id, find_elements_by_name, etc.), which will return a list of
matching WebElement objects.
